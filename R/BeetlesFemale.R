#' BeetlesFemale dataset
#' 
#' @details This is an example dataset which was used as a simulated toy dataset for a different purpose 
#' (Nakagawa & Schielzeth 2013). 
#' It offers a balanced dataset with rather simple structure and sizable effects. 
#' Sufficient sample size is required in particular for the non-Gaussian traits, 
#' because those tend to be more computationally demanding and less rich in information per data 
#' point than simple Gaussian traits.
#' In brief the imaginary sampling design of the simulated dataset is as follows. 
#' Beetle larvae were sampled from 12 populations (`Population`) with samples taken from two 
#' discrete microhabitats at each location (`Habitat`). Samples were split in equal proportion 
#' and raised in two dietary treatments (`Treatment`). Beetles were sexed at the pupal stage (`Sex`) 
#' and pupae were kept in sex-homogeneous containers (`Container`). 
#' The phenotype in this dataset is the number of eggs laid by female beetles (`Egg`).
