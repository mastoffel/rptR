![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mastoffel/rptR.svg?branch=master)

`rptR` provides a collection of functions for calculating point estimates, interval estimates and significance tests of the repeatability (intra-class correlation coefficient) of measurements. The function `rpt` is a the core functions that calls more specialised functions as required. Specialised functions can also be called directly (see `?rpt` for details). All functions return lists of values. The function `?summary.rpt` produces summaries in a detailed format.
