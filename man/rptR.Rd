\title{rptR: Repeatability calculation for Gaussian and Non-Gaussian data}
\description{
A collection of functions for caluculating point estimates, interval estimates and 
significance tests of the repeatability (intra-class correlation coefficient) of measurements.
The function \link{rpt} is a the core functions that calls more specialised functions as required. 
Specialised functions can also be called directly (see \link{rpt} for details).
All functions return lists of values. The function \link{summary.rpt} produces summaries in a detailed format.
}
\note{
Currently there is are a number of functions that use the two arguments \code{y} and \code{groups} to 
estimate standard repeatabilities (see e.g. function \link{rpt}). There is another group of 
functions (e.g. \link{rpt.adj}) that uses the agruments \code{formula} and \code{grname}, which allows 
estimating adjusted repeatabilities (controlling for fixed effects) and the estimation of multiple variance 
components simulatneously (multiple random effects). In the long run, the two groups of functions will be merged 
and will use the more flexible fomula arguments. So far, adjusted repeatabilities are only implemented for 
Gaussian data using REML estimation.
