\description{
Dataset containing information on intraspecific brood parasitsim in a population of domesticated zebra finches.
}
\details{
Females were allowed to breed for three month in 2005 and for three month in 2006. 
They lived in aviaries with 6-9 females and 6-9 males per aviary. 
Individuals were swapped among aviaries between the 2005 and the 2006 breeding season,
but some females were used in one season only. 
Hatchling and embryos were genotyped and parentage was assigned by exclusion. 
About 21% of all clutches that were initiated and incubated by a social pair contained at 
least one dumped egg (that was laid by another female).
Many females applied a mixed strategy combining caring for own clutches with brood parasitism.
Some unpaired (or part-time paired) females also applied brood parasitism.
